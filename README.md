# PiggyTestGame
Created a functioning game based on a popular Roblox game called "Piggy". In this project I attempt to recreate the game module following a Youtube tutorial. This project has helped me to learn a new coding language, Lua, and experience game development. 


### Game Walk-though

- [x] Created a crouch animation using roblox studio and implemented code that slows down the user when that animation is enabled.

- [x] When fired at the intended player, "Piggy", implements code that prevents the player from moving for a duration of time.
